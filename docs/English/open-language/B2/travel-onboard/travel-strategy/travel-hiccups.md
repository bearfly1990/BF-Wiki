# Travel Hiccups

## Conversation

A: Hey, you look great! How was your trip to Guilin?

B: It was great. The beautiful scenery helped energize me, but I ran ito a few **hicupps**.

---

A: Oh, what happened?

B: I packed some toiletries in my packed bag, but some of them leaked out.

---

A: That's terriable.

B: Yeah, and to add insult to injury, the leakage made all of my clothes dirty.

---

A: So did you buy some clothes there?

B: Yeah, this really made me paranoid about leakage. Now I'd just pack the most essential toiletries.

---

A: That's true. You can probably pack a change of clothes in your carry-on bag.

B: That's a good idea. I do need to prepare more. You never know what will happen.

---

A: You're right. BTW, did you know that you need to go on a business trip next week?

B: What? I didn't know that. Sounds like I'll be living out of my suitcase for a bit. Where do I need to go?

--

A: Let me see. Ah, you need to arrive in Shanghai on Tuesday by 7:30 in the morning.

B: Oh, so I'll probably need to take a red-eye flight.

---

A: Or your can plan to arrive Monday night.

B: Let me check my schedule. I hope everything goes according to plan this time.
