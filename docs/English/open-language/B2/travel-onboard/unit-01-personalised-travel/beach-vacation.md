# Beach Vacation

A: Hey, do you want to go to the beach with me for the next vacation?

B: Sure, **I'm easy**. If we go to the beach, I'll get to try **snorkeling**.

---

A: Snorkeling is good, but I prefer **scuba diving**.

B: I'm a little bit scared of **scuba diving**. I can just **chill out** on the beach if you want to do it.

---

A: Scuba diving isn't scary at all as long as you have an instructor with you. But relaxing on the beach is pretty nice too.

B: Yep, nothing beats **sunbathing** on a golden beach. We'll need to take enough **sunscreen** with us.

---

A: Yeah, but I bet you'll still get tanned.

B: That's what I want. I think a **tan** makes me look healthy. By the way, which beach will we go to?

---

A: A new beach Apryl showed me is not crowded at all.

B: Brilliant! Is it completely **pristine**, or can we see lots of crabs and **jellyfish**?

---

A: Hmm, we may probaly see some crabs, but I hope no jellyfish. We'll have to watch out for them.

B: For sure. But regardless of what happens, I promise I'll have fun!

---

A: me too.
