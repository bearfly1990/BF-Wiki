# Changing a Flight Booking

## Conversation

A: There was a thunderstorm last week. Was your trip affected?

B: Of course it was affected. My **connecting flight** was canceled.

---

A: Bad news. When did you learn that the flight was canceled?

B: We already boarded the **outgoing flight**, but it was unable to take off due to the weather.

---

A: How could this happen? I thought the outgoing flight wouldn't be canceled if the passengers alreay boarded.

B: Actually even the flights can be canceled **on account of** bad weather.

---

A: So you stopped in Wuhan. How did you get to Guangzhou then?

B: We didn't want to change the **itinerary** too much, so we had a 7-hour stopover.

---

A: Seven hours? Why didn't you try to reroute yourself through another city?

B: Because the other flights only had **aisle seats**, which Jane hates, so we could only wait for that one.

---

A: I didn't know she was that picky.

B: Luckily, no matter which flight we changed to, there were no **hidden fees**.

---

A: Yeah, but the process sounds a bit annoying, right?

B: It wasn't too bad, we just gave the **confirmation number** to the staff and they took care of it.
