B: It's easier said than done. You have to make plans in advance.

A: Is there a marked trail going up the mountain?

B: Yes, but the second half of the trek got really steep.

A: Wow, it does sound hard. Did you ever think about giving up?

B: I really thought about it when I slipped on the steep slope.

A: But it sounds like you didn't give up?

B: I decided to push the limit. see if Icould finish the trek

A: But there's no shame in going back down.

B: I just wanted to give it a try. And after they got me a hiking stick, I was able to make it to the top.

A: That's great, but don't push yourself too hard if it's a dangerous situation.

B: Of course, we don't want any accidents. I'm always careful.

A: I believe you. So were there any streams or rivers along the trail?

B: Yes, but they're not clean, so you should bring your own water to stay hydrated.
