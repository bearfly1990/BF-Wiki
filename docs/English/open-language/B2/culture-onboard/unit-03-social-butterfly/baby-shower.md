# Baby Shower

A: Did you hear that Kate is pregnant? And she's due next month.

B: Really? I don't even know that she was expecting a baby!

---

A: Well, I guess you'll get a party invitation today. She already mentioned it to me.

B: You mean the baby shower? Then I'll have to get some gifts for her and the baby!

---

A: Yeah. I bought a pacifier for the baby. They can definitely use it when the baby cries, right?

B: Sounds great. Since you got a pacifier, I guess I should get something else. How about a versatile stroller?

---

A: Yeah, a stroller is great. But it might be very expensive, and it's not so easy to pick the right stroller for them.

B: Got it. So how about an adorable onesie? My nephew has a lot of onesies. They are all very cute!

---

A: Yeah! A cute onesie is a must for a baby!

B: Right? I think Kate will be cooing over the onesie, I mean, the baby in onesie!

---

A: I bet! How about we go shopping today? Jessica also asked me to buy some diapers for her. She couldn't make to the store herself.

B: So you'll send the diaperts on behalf of Jessica, right?
