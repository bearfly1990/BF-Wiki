# Ordering drinks

A: Hey! Are you up for a drink tonight?, We need to celebrate the end of the project.

B: Yeah! How about Greate Leap? They've got a new drink menu, and added some amazing craft beer.

---

A: Well, I don't know much about beer. I'm more into whiskey, Scotish whiskey, it's so delicious!

B: Yeah, we all know that. Do you prefer to have it on the rocks or neat?

---

A: It depends. Sometimes I will get a whiskey on the rocks, just to avoid getting hammered so soon. Let's meet later tonigh at my favorite whiskey bar, and then head to Great Leap after a drink or two.

B: Perfect. The first round of drinks is on me!

---

A: Good evening! What can I get for you?

B: Let's all go for a shot of whiskey, shall we? Then I'll order another whiskey by the bottle.

---

A: Woah woah woah, no rush! I'm kind of a lightweight. I'll probably just have it by the glass.

B: Oh, okay. I dont's want us to be hammered, a little tipsy will do just fine.

---

A: I totally agree. I feel like we had enough drinks already.

B: Weel, are you still up for another round, or do you want to call it a night instead?

---

A: Let's just call it a night. I'm already tipsy now. I bet you don't want to see me. going further than this.
