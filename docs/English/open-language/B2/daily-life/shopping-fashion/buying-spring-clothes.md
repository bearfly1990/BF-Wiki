# Buying Spring Clothes

## Conversation

👩: Hey, Why do you always look so chic?

👧: It's not that hard. You just need to wear something fashionable.

---

👩: But I don't know anything about fashion. You know what? I need to go to my friend Jane's wedding. But I don't know what to wear.

👧: Don't worry. Let me find something that **goes well with** your hair and skin tone.

---

👩: That's so nice of you.

👧: Let me see. What about this jumpsuit?

---

👩: It looks nice, but it's not convenient for going to the bathroom.

👧: You mean the **cargo shorts** you're wearing? I'm afraid that's not good for a wedding.

---

👩: OK. Let's see something else.

👧: Yeah, and the shorts are too **baggy**. I'll bet you'd look good in some **skinny** pants with a nice top.

---

👩: Oh, I don't like tight-fitting clothes.They're uncomfortable.

👧: My dear, loose-fitting clothes won't show off your figure. Ah, I know! Try this **ruffle** dress

---

👩: Wow, I like the flowers on it.

👧: Yeah, a good **floral** print never goes out of style. It'll really freshen up your look.

---

👩: OK, thanks, I'll try it on. But it might be too cold in this dress. It's still early spring.

👧: So you need a trench coat. Check this on out!

---

👩: Great Thanks!
