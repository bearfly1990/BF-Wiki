👩: What? Then I should keep track of my ID card carefully. What does it have to do with credit cards?

👩: That's great. I hope the bank can set up a verification program to verify the identify of card users in the future.

👩: Haha I once used my mother's credit card to buy clothes. I'm not sure if she received a text alert or not.
