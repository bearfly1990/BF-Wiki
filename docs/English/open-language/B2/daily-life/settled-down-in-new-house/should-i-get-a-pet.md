# Should I get a pet?

## Conversation

👨🏻‍💼: Can I help you?

👧: Yeah, I'm looking for a pet, but I'm still **on the fence** about what kind.

---

👨🏻‍💼: You can't decide what to buy? Do you need a recommendation?

👧: Sure, I'm really looking for a **companion** animal.

---

👨🏻‍💼: What about a dog? They're willing to stay with you a long time.

👧: I love dogs, but they **shed** a lot and I don't have time to **groom** a dog every day.

---

👨🏻‍💼: That makes sense. Dogs also need a lot of accompany, and to be taken for walks every day.

👧: Yeah, I work late every day, and having a dog **comes with** a lot of trouble. It's not going to work.

---

👨🏻‍💼: I see. Why not get yourself a cat? They can clean themselves and play alone.

👧: Oh, I love cats. I adopted a cat from the **animal shelter** two years ago. It was **rescued** by the volunteers.

---

👨🏻‍💼: Oh, your cat must be the luckiest cat in the world! Why not get a second cat?

👧: But I'm allergic to cats. So I found her a new owner, **who's committed to** taking care of her.

---

👨🏻‍💼: What about a bunny? They are furry and cute!

👧: Good idea. Having a cute little bunny would **go a long way towards** improving my mood.

---

👨🏻‍💼: Definitely. Bunnies are furry and cute. You'll forget all your unhappiness while playing with them, trust me.

👧: Sounds great. It'll be **rewarding** to have a bunny around the house. Let's find one that needs a good home.
