# Rent an Apartment

## Conversation

👨‍💼👨🏻‍💼🦸‍♂️🧙‍♂️🧑🏻
👩‍💼👩🏻‍💼👩👧
👩: I heard you wanted to move. Have you found a new apartment yet?

🧑🏻: Not yet. I'm looking for **listings** online. There are a lot of options but not many work for me.

---

👩: Really? What kind of apartment are you looking for?

🧑🏻: Well, I want a **fully furnished** apartment. And I want the furniture to be new.

---

👩: That's goign to be hard. Most apartments for rent don't have new furniture, especially if it's a shared apartment.

🧑🏻: Hmm, actually I don't want to live with other **tenants** or with the landlord.

---

👩: Alright. That's going to be more expensive. What's your budget?

🧑🏻: Well, **in terms of** rent, it depends on the space and features. I don't have a budget **per se**. But I don't want to pay a **deposit**.

---

👩: You wish! Everyone has to pay a deposit. How long do you want your lease for?

🧑🏻: You mean the **lease**? Three months. I just need a place for the short term.

---

👩: I see, I might know an agent with an apartment for short term lease.

🧑🏻: Cool! Could you **put me in contact with** the agent?

---

👩: Sure. I'll text you his phone number later.

🧑🏻: Great. I hope I can do a **workthrough** before the weekend. I can't wait!

---

👩: With luck, you'll move into your new apartment soon.

🧑🏻: Yeah, Let's hope I can **seal the deal** as soon as possible.
