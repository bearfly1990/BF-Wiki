# Car Rental

## Conversation

👨🏻‍💼: We should rent a compact car for our first week in the city.

🦸‍♂️: Then **upgrade** to an SUV when we start our road trip?

---

👨🏻‍💼: Sure! Look! This SUV with a stick shift is so cheap.

🦸‍♂️: Well, we aren't experienced driving stick, so it's better to go with an **automatic** car.

---

👨🏻‍💼: Fine. Should we get roadside protection?

🦸‍♂️: I think my credit card covers that. Let me double check.

---

👨🏻‍💼: Hope it does. It can save us some money. Should we get unlimited mileage?

🦸‍♂️: We'll need to drive at least 500 miles, so unlimited **mileage** fits us better.

---

👨🏻‍💼: Right, right. This company is the cheapest. But the drop off point is far away.

🦸‍♂️: Well, that might be an issue. Maybe look for a closer **drop off** point?

---

👨🏻‍💼: This one then! I can even drop it off with an empty gas tank. We don't need to fill it up.

🦸‍♂️: Still don't you think we should do a **visual inspection** before taking the car?

---

👨🏻‍💼: But we can return with an empty tank. They give us a spare tire too, and flexible drop off points. It's the best deal!

🦸‍♂️: Alright, let's get us on our way and book it now.
