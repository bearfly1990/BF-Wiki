## Conversation

A: You look pale. Is everything OK?

B: Well, it's my neck. I've had a **dull** ache for a few days and every time I try to move, it starts cracking.

---

A: Have you taken any medicine?

B: Yeah. But they did nothing to **alleviate** the pain.

---

A: It's probably because of your lifestyle. You're allways sitting at your desk, right?

B: I know being **sedentary** isn't good for my health. But you know, there's no way out.

---

A: Emm, why don't you go to a **chiropractic** clinic?

B: I've never really considered it. To be frank, I'm afraid of doing things like **acupuncture**.

---

A: Don't worry. It's safe. I got **acupuncture** and it fixed my frozen shoulder!

B: Really? Do you think I could get **back full function** in my neck?

---

A: It worked for me, at least. I guess it depends on your situation.

B: I just don't know what to expect, so can you tell me the **ins and outs** of the treatment.

---

A: Well, the doctor will tell you everything. You really need to talk to a professional about it.

B: Okay, to avoid problems **down the road**, I guess I'd better go to the clinic tomorrow.
