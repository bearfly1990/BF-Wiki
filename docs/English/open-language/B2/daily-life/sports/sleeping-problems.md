# Sleeping Problems

## Conversation

A: Hey, why do you look so tired?

B: Well, I'm **suffering** from insomnia. And I'm always **restless** when I try to sleep.

---

A: Ah, that's why you aren't drinking coffee these days.

B: Yeah, drinking coffee takes a **toll on** my sleep, so I've decided to **get off** it.

---

A: Wise choice, but it sounds like it hasn't fixed your **insomnia**.

B: Yeah, so I'm considering whether it could be **triggered** by something else.

---

A: Hmm, are you stressed out at work? Insomnia can be triggered by anxiety.

B: A little bit. So I also try to **wind down** by doing some yoga before going to sleep.

---

A: Maybe it's not enough to balance all the stress.

B: So what can I do? Should I try sleep aids?

---

A: I think you should go to a doctor if it's serious. Even though insomnia is common, it's still a kind of sleep disorder.

B: Really? I thought a sleep disorder was something like sleepwalking.
