👨🏻‍💼: To **engaged** your **abs**, I think you can add sit-ups to your routine.

🧑🏻: Really, I don't think I could manage that. Right now I just prefer strength training. I'm just lifting weights.

👨🏻‍💼: Cool, the last time Itried bench press, I couldn't even do three **reps**.

---

🧑🏻: Have you tried any kind of strength training?

👨🏻‍💼: Not yet. I'm focusing more on cardio, so I sometimes go jogging. On a **treadmill**, I mean.

---

🧑🏻: What else are you planning to add to your routine?

👨🏻‍💼: I could use some **stretching**, too, like after I work out, to reduce muscle aches.

🧑🏻: Great. It's good to get back to the gym. I've been slacking!

👨🏻‍💼: **Give it your all**. You'll get back into it in no time.

🧑🏻: Thanks I will try.
