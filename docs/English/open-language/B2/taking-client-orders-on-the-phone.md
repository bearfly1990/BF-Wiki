## Tips

【Invoice】: a list of goods that have been sold ,work have been done.showing what you must pay . 发票，（发货或服务的）费用清单 ，同义词为“Bill”账单

（一般用于交货或完工后卖方给买方的账单，上面显示你需要缴纳的费用。）

【 通知你需要缴费的钱】（没扣款）

【Receipt】：a piece of paper that shows that goods or services have been paid for

收据收条 （卖方确认收到钱后给买方出具的收据，证明他们已收到你缴费的钱）

【证明已扣费的凭证】（已扣款）

在需要采购的物品较多、数量较大的情况下，买家会先把要购买的货物项目和数量列成purchase order发送给卖家。卖家收到后会加上货品单价，折扣，税收，支付时间等有关支付的信息制成invoice返还给买家。

*[invoice]: 费用清单
